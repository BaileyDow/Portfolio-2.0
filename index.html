                    <div class="item-double">
                        <p>I have worked in many fields through out my life. I've worked in food, electronic repair, customer service, and as of recently coding.
                             Still new to coding I feel like it is something that I have picked up on very fast because I enjoy it more than previous fields I have worked in.
                             I really enjoy the structure it has and also the way you can go at code in many different ways with many different languages.
                             Also being able to work in a team always makes makes me happy because I am very much so a people person. Technical coaching on 
                             both my side and others is something I am very passionate about because it really helps you learn to solve problems.</p>

                        <p>Though I love coding and working its not what my whole life entails.
                            I have many interests out side of work and even some that relate to my work!
                            Some of those interests involve gaming, cooking, and making music. 
                            If you happen to enjoy any of these things it may help to relate to the work I can do for you!!
